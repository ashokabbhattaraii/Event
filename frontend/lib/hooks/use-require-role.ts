// Race-free page guard for role-restricted routes.
//
// The pattern this replaces was `if (!user || !allowed.includes(user.role))
// notFound()` evaluated straight through during render. That has two bugs:
//
//  1. `user` is undefined for the first render(s) while useCurrentUser
//     resolves, so the guard fired for legitimate organizers/admins too.
//  2. Because it bailed out of the component before AppShell mounted, the
//     central role-access guard inside AppShell never got the chance to run
//     — so the page could also render for the WRONG role depending on
//     timing, which is exactly how an attendee ended up on an organizer
//     edit page.
//
// Instead this reports an explicit three-state gate, so callers can render
// a loader while the session is still unknown and only commit to a decision
// once it isn't. A denied user is sent to their own home (or /login when
// signed out) rather than shown a dead end.
//
// This is UI routing only — never the security boundary. The server
// independently enforces the same rules (authorize()/requireRole() on every
// route), which is what actually protects the data.

  // no localStorage, so reading it inline would desync the first client
  // render from the server HTML and trip a hydration mismatch. `checked`
  // distinguishes "no token" from "haven't looked yet" — without it the
  // first render looks identical to signed-out and bounces to /login.
