// A request from one organization to another to co-host a specific event.
//
// Co-hosting hands the invited organization's admins real access to the
// event: the full attendee roster (names, emails, payment records), check-in,
// analytics and event details. That cannot be granted unilaterally, so this
// model makes the grant a two-party agreement — the invitation is created in
// "pending", and only an admin of the INVITED organization can move it to
// "accepted", which is the single moment the co-host link is written.
//
// This mirrors the consent model the AI suggestion flow already used
// (CollaborationSuggestion's statusA/statusB handshake). The manual path
// previously bypassed it entirely: the "Invite" button wrote straight into
// Event.coHostOrganizations, so an organization could be given another org's
// attendee data without agreeing to it, or even being told.
