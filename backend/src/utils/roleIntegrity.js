// can't notice when the DATABASE still holds the pre-split shape — which is
// precisely how tenant admins silently lost access to their own events
// after the split: the role checks were correct, the rows weren't, and
// nothing anywhere said so. The failure surfaced only as a confusing
// "you're not authorized" in the UI.

// Best-effort and non-fatal: it only reports. A boot check that could take
// the server down over a data shape is worse than the drift it detects.
