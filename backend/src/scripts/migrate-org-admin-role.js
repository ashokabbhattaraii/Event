/**
 * Data migration: split the overloaded "admin" role into "admin" (platform
 * system administrator) and "org_admin" (tenant administrator).
 *
 * Before the role split, a tenant's administrator was stored as
 * role: "admin" WITH an organization set, and the platform administrator as
 * role: "admin" with NO organization. That inference-based distinction is
 * what allowed a tenant admin to reach platform-wide surfaces (the AI
 * training console retrains models shared across every tenant), so the two
 * are now separate, explicit roles.
 *
 * This backfills existing rows to match:
 *
 *     role: "admin" AND organization set   ->  role: "org_admin"
 *     role: "admin" AND no organization    ->  unchanged (system admin)
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running it is a no-op once every row is converted, because
 * the filter only ever matches rows still carrying the legacy shape.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT bump tokenVersion. protect() re-reads the user
 * document (and therefore the role) from the database on every request, so
 * the new, narrower permissions take effect immediately on the next request
 * without forcing every tenant admin to sign in again.
 *
 * Run with:  npm run migrate:org-admin
