"""Rule-based slot extraction for the chatbot's NLU layer.

Intent classification alone can't express modifiers like "just one event"
vs. "list events", or "past" vs. "upcoming" — a flat intent label is a
single value from a closed set, not a set of independent parameters. These
are slot-filling questions, not classification questions: adding them as
new *intents* (e.g. `upcoming_events_single`) would pollute the taxonomy
with what's really a quantity modifier on an existing intent, and adding
them as a second ML output head isn't justified either — there's no
training-data ambiguity here for a model to resolve (a message either
contains a singular quantifier next to "event" or it doesn't), so a small
deterministic extractor is both the simplest and the most reliable choice.

This was previously duplicated as three separate regex helpers inside the
Node backend (chatbotController.js). Centralizing it here means the backend
calls one `/parse` endpoint for both intent (ML) and slots (rules) instead
of re-implementing NLU logic in two languages; Node keeps its own copies
only as an offline fallback for when this service is unreachable.
