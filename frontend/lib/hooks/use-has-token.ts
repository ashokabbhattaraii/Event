// Whether a session token exists in localStorage — used to gate every
// auth-only query (`enabled: useHasToken()`).
//
// This intentionally starts at `false` on every render, including the very
// first one in the browser, and only flips to the real value inside an
// effect. Reading localStorage synchronously during render instead (the
// previous `typeof window !== "undefined" && !!localStorage.getItem(...)`
// pattern) makes the first client render diverge from the server-rendered
// HTML — the server never sees `window`, so it always renders the
// logged-out branch, while the client's first render already has the token
// and renders the logged-in branch. React hydrates against the server
// output, so that first-paint mismatch throws a hydration error and forces
// a full client re-render. Starting both renders at `false` keeps the first
// paint identical; the effect-driven flip afterwards is a normal state
// update, not a hydration diff.
